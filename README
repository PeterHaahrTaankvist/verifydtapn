## Linux
To compile:
```
sudo apt install flex bison libboost-all-dev libsparsehash-dev

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Max OS X

Install xcode through App Store.

Install cmake, boost and google-sparsehash,
for example using homebrew as follows:

```
brew install cmake boost google-sparsehash 
```

If your flex and bison point to a wrong binary, run the cmake
with the folowing switches where the desired path is set:

cmake -DBISON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/flex/bin/flex ..
